## PREFIXES

# CURIE namespaces (prefixes/base URI's) mappings of prefixes used in the body of
# the Baselink Model specification are resolved using a specific precedence order,
# for use in the generation of the Baselink Model context.jsonld mappings to
# namespaces. Any prefixes encountered in the Baselink Model but not resolved by
# the following precedence sources, are anonymously declared by linkml as
# http://example.org/UNKNOWN/ rooted base URI's which should ideally be repaired
# in one of the precedence lists.
#
# 1. The following 'prefixes:' delimited list has first precedence in resolution.

  ## QUALIFIERS
  ## -------------------

  aspect qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Composes with the core concept to describe new concepts of a different ontological type. e.g. a process in which
      the core concept participates, a function/activity/role held by the core concept, or a characteristic/quality that
      inheres in the core concept.  The purpose of the aspect slot is to indicate what aspect is being affected in an
      'affects' association.
    examples:
      - value: stability
      - value: abundance
      - value: expression
      - value: exposure

  derivative qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      A qualifier that composes with a core subject/object  concept to describe something that is derived from the
      core concept.  For example, the qualifier ‘controller’ combines with a ‘Control X’ core concept to express
      the composed concept ‘a controller of Control X’.
    examples:
      - value: controller

  part qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      defines a specific part/component of the core concept (used in cases there this specific part has no IRI we can
      use to directly represent it.
    examples:
      - value: upstream control region

  context qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Restricts the setting/context/location where the core concept (or qualified core concept) resides or occurs.
    examples:
      - value: cohort x
      - value: milk
      - value: english language
    notes: >-
      the context qualifier ‘goal’ combines with a core concept of ‘soccer’ to express the composed concept ‘goal in
      the soccer’. The soccer_context_qualifier applies taxonomic context, e.g. soccer-specific operational activity

  direction qualifier:
    is_a: association slot
    abstract: true
    description: >-
      Composes with the core concept (+ aspect if provided) to describe a change in its direction or degree.
    notes: >-
      the qualifier ‘increased’ combines with a core concept of ‘Thing X’ and an aspect of ‘expression’ to express the composed concept ‘increased expression of Thing X’
      the qualifier ‘decreased’ combines with a core concept of ‘Plant X’ and an aspect of ‘abundance’ to express the composed concept ‘decreased abundance of Plant X’

  narrow matches:
    description: >-
      A list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have
      a narrower meaning. Such terms often describe a more specific concept

    multivalued: true

  broad matches:
    description: >-
      A list of terms from different schemas or terminology systems that have
      a broader meaning. Such terms often describe a more general concept
      from different ontological perspectives.
    multivalued: true

  qualified predicate:
    is_a: association slot
    description: >-
      Predicate to be used in an association when subject and object qualifiers are present and the full
      reading of the statement requires a qualification to the predicate in use in order to refine or
      increase the specificity of the full statement reading.  This qualifier holds a relationship to be used instead of that
      expressed by the primary predicate, in a ‘full statement’ reading of the association, where qualifier-based
      semantics are included.  This is necessary only in cases where the primary predicate does not work in a
      full statement reading.
    notes: >-
      to express the statement that “Control X causes increased expression of Service Y”, the core triple is read
      using the fields subject:ChemX, predicate:affects, object:ServiceY . . . and the full statement is read using
      the fields subject:ChemX, qualified_predicate:causes, object:ServiceY, object_aspect: expression,
      object_direction:increased. The predicate ‘affects’ is needed for the core triple reading, but doesnt make
      sense in the full statement reading  (because “Control X affects increased expression of Service Y'' is not
      what we mean to say here: it causes increased expression of Service Y)

    description: >-
      Expresses a relationship between two named things where the relationship is typically generated statistically
      (though not in all cases), and is weaker than its child, 'correlated with', but stronger than its parent,
      'related to'. This relationship holds between two concepts represented by variables for which a statistical
      dependence is demonstrated. E.g. the statement “A is associated with B"
      asserts that having A is not statistically independent from whether a patient
      will also have B. Note that in Translator associations, the subject and object concepts may map exactly to
      the statistical variables, or represent related entities for which the variables serve as proxies in an
      Association (e.g. faults, contro entities or processes)

      a base compatible KG can be considered both instances of base classes, and

         This is modeled as a mixin. 'ontology class' should not be the primary type of a
         node in the KG. Instead you should use an informative base category, such as DeploymentEntity

         Note that formally this is a metaclass. Instances of this class are instances in the graph,
         but can be the object of 'type' edges.
